# ChunkedUpload-Meraati
Code to implement a Chunked Upload system using JavaScript and a modern user interface based on Bootstrap.
Uses of piecemeal upload code
Upload files larger than server limits:

Many servers have size limits for uploaded files (eg 2MB or 100MB). Using chunked upload, the file is divided into smaller parts and each part is sent to the server separately. This approach allows the user to upload very large files (eg more than 1 GB) without problems.
Improved user experience:

Uploading large files usually takes a long time. By using this code, the user can see the progress of the upload, which improves the user experience. Also, using the drag and drop feature makes it easier for the user to select files.
Reliable upload in unstable connection conditions:

In case of network disconnection during upload, it is possible to resend un-uploaded sections, without having to re-upload the entire file. This is very useful in situations where the Internet connection is unstable (for example, when traveling or on public networks).
Increase server performance:

A chunked upload allows the server to process several smaller requests instead of handling one large upload request. This approach can reduce the pressure on the server and lead to better load balancing.
The ability to upload multiple files at the same time:

This code supports uploading multiple files at the same time and displays a separate progress bar for each file. This feature is very useful for users who need to upload a set of files (such as images, videos, documents, etc.).
Support for different types of files:

The upload code can be used for different files (images, videos, documents, ZIP files, etc.). This flexibility makes the code suitable for a variety of different applications on websites.
Add drag and drop functionality:

The drag and drop feature allows the user to easily drag and drop files to the upload area, which can improve the user experience and reduce the time required to select files.
Uses in practical applications
File sharing websites: Services like Google Drive, Dropbox or similar services use this type of upload to manage large files.
Content Management Systems (CMS): Sites that require uploading videos, images, and other large media files (such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal).
Interactive web applications: platforms such as online video and image editors, where users upload large files for processing.
Cloud systems or data processing: Upload large data for analysis and processing on cloud servers.
Software Development Projects: Any project that requires users or customers to upload large files, such as uploading forms to admin panels or business sites.
summary
This code is suitable for any application that needs to upload large files, improve user experience, and increase reliability in unstable connection conditions. Also, this code can be easily added to web applications and effectively improve performance and user experience.
